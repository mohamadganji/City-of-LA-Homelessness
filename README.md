# City of LA Homelessness Geospacial Visualization Dashboard
In this Project we collected, enriched and merged relevant data to create metrics showing the homelessness condition in the city of LA.
Then, we created a geospatial visualization dashboard to effectively deliver this information to the city of LA's officials.
The dashboard is built using R-shiny with integration of leaflet for interactive map features.
